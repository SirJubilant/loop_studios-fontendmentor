# loop_studios-fontendmentor
A frontend mentor project

i picked up this project from front-end mentor to help sharpenn my skills.

it has been interesting, aproaching different challenges during the course of developing this site has opened my eyes to possibilities i never knew existed before now.

using my knowledge of CSS grid and FLEX, responsive design and a functional menu has made everything worthwhile.

thanks to frontend mentor for putting up this challenge for free.
